Maze maker and solver created for Fundamentals of Computer Science II

Collaborators: Melody Yu and Ella Demarest

Created for CS2510

## Introduction
This is a maze maker where players can enter what size maze they would like to have, and have the ability to have the computer solve it for them using breadth first or depth first search. Each maze is different, and there are mazes of all different sizes.

## How to Play
After running the program, the user can press the "b" key (instantiating bfs), or the "d" key (instantiating dfs). Once a key is pressed, the search is animated using light blue colored squares. Once the maze is solved, the shortest path is highlighted using dark blue.

To reset the game, the user can press "r", and a new maze will be created.
